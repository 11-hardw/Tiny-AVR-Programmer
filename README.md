The Tiny AVR Programmer plugs directly into your USB port and provides a programming socket for the ATtiny45 and 85.

This was a collaboration with David Mellis and the MIT High Low Tech lab. See [Programming an ATtiny with Arduino 1.0](http://hlt.media.mit.edu/?p=1695) and [Using the TinyProgrammer](http://hlt.media.mit.edu/?p=1801) for more drivers and additional information.
